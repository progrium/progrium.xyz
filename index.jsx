      <p class="my-4">
      I'm a creator and entrepreneur known for my work and ideas in open source developer tooling.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
      I try to push the boundaries of the computer as a magical tool and compiler for the imagination.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
      Otherwise I enjoy making indie games and producing music. Someday I'd like to make films.
